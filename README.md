# Survey form with React


The aim of this project was to build a short survey using React to store data as the State form. The site should be accessible. 

## The problem

I used the hook "useState".The React components were relatively straightforward to build, once a flow had been established. I used CSS to style the form, which was quite involved. I added a previous button - so that the user could go back. I am particularly happy about the conditional rendering aspect , seen in the AnimalChoises component.

If there was more time, I would add a progress bar
