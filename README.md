# Survey form with React


The aim of this project was to build a short survey using React to store data as the State form. The site should be accessible. 

## The problem

I used the hook "useState".The React components were relatively straightforward to build, once a flow had been established. I used CSS to style the form, which was quite involved. I added a previous button - so that the user could go back. I am particularly happy about the conditional rendering aspect , seen in the AnimalChoises component. I also disabled a button so that the user could not continue, perhaps one of the nicest ways to add validation to a form ;-)
I am more proud of my work ethic this week: I worked long hours to code when I could and am proud of what I achieved.

If there was more time, I would add a progress bar
